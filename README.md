# Least-squares-approximation-v2
Least squares approximation of function y = a * x / (b + x), tried several ways: scipy.optimize.curve_fit(), scipy.linalg.lstsq(), also tried to transform function, variable substitution. There was also a problem with zero point in data, so had to slice the list of values ([1:])
